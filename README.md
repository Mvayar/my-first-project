# my-first-project
- Hi! I'm Mayar, CS student at King Faisal Univercity.
- I'm always looking for big challenges to develop my programming skills.
- I made this program with my teammates as a little project to test our abilities and do whatever it takes to submet my work on time. The system is used by supermarket to add products, locations...etc in a self-service shopping center! Thats it, hope you enjoy. 
"I would like to mention my teammates who I worked with me but I dont know if they have github accounts or not."
