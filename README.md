# my-first-project
- Hi! I'm Mayar, CS student at King Faisal Univercity.
- I'm always looking for big challenges to improve my programming skills.
- The purpose of this project is to learn the basics and to improve our programming skills, to develop programs in an advanced way, and to save time and effort for the users. So, the system is used by supermarket to add products, locations...etc in a self-service shopping center! Thats it, hope you enjoy.
